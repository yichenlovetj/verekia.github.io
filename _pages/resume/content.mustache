In a small team of about 4 Front-End Engineers, I developed features and components for Yelp's site and mobile web app, to serve fast pages to more than <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/factsheet">90 million</a> unique visitors per month; with a strong focus on creating a robust and sustainable CSS codebase. I was involved in developer relations and recruiting, and brought <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/61279952/">SFHTML5</a> to Yelp. We worked with SASS, OOCSS, a UI styleguide, JavaScript, and Python.

I developed HTML5, GWT, Google App Engine, and Android apps at the Innovation Department of SFEIR. We won a French Google Chrome HTML5 app contest with one of the first <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kadoojjbafjcfdjcafflfnoimccbnlfd" target="_blank">web-based music player</a> for Chrome.

<h3>Author of a book about HTML5</h3>

I co-wrote a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dunod.com/informatique-multimedia/developpement/developpement-web/html5">book about HTML5</a> which covers a wide range of features, such as: semantics, microdata, audio and video, canvas, web sockets, offline apps, etc. The foreword is by Paul Irish, from the Google Chrome team. I also wrote a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Livre/savoir-tout-faire-pour-le-web-css3-htlm5-et-jquery-9782361450434">guest chapter</a> in another book about HTML5</a>, and an article in <a href="http://www.webdesignmag.fr/" target="_blank">Web Design Magazine</a>.</p>

<h3>JS-Stack-from-Scratch</h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/">JavaScript Stack from Scratch</a> is my most significant open source contribution. It's a tutorial about setting up a modern JavaScript and React stack with all its related tools like Redux, Webpack, ESLint, Flow, or Jest. It had a great impact on the JS community, with more than 16.000 stars on Github.


<h3>Initializr</h3>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.initializr.com">Initializr</a> is my contribution to the community to make the web better by accelerating the creation of new HTML5 projects. It is the official custom build tool of <a target="_blank" href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. Initializr receives a traffic of 42.000 visitors per month, generating 15.000 downloads, has more than 8000 <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/initializr">Twitter followers</a>, and a total of 2500 <a href="https://github.com/verekia/" target="_blank">Github stars</a>.

<h3>Blogging and social media audience</h3>

 It comes naturally to me to explain technical topics clearly. My blog about front-end development, <a target="_blank" href="http://verekia.com">verekia.com</a>, receives about 20.000 visitors per month. I have also built a wide audience of web developers on social media with more than 9000 <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/verekia">Twitter followers</a>. This audience can be reached with front-end content.

<h3>Public speaking</h3>

I gave talks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/61279952/">SFHTML5</a>, the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2012/speakers.php" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/_pages/resume/img/gtug.jpg">Google Developer Group in Paris</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/paris-webComponents/events/213319332/">Pars Web Components</a>, <a href="/_pages/resume/img/sfeirplays.jpg" target="_blank">Sfeir'Plays</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://bestofweb.paris/">Best of Web 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Js-Star/events/233966860/" target="_blank">JS Star</a>, and several internal presentations at Yelp and Sfeir.

<h2>Education and Languages</h2>

I have a Master in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_pour_l%27informatique_et_les_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es" target="_blank">EPITA</a>, where I learned programming, data structures, algorithms, UNIX, web and mobile development, and much more (mostly coded in C, Java, and PHP). I was a student representative, won an <a target="_blank" href="https://csiweb.ucd.ie/news/first-ucd-epita-android-workshop-great-success">Android contest</a> with the University College of Dublin, and organized the <a target="_blank" href="/_pages/resume/img/Open-Source-Day-2010.png">Open Source Day 2010</a>.
